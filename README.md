# ECHO – Effective Conversations for Healthcare Optimization

ECHO is an AI-powered clinical simulation platform that helps healthcare providers practice culturally responsive patient communication. The application combines a React front-end with Firebase Cloud Functions that call Google Gemini to generate virtual patients, manage conversations and provide real-time coaching.  This release is a fully working baseline v0.4.

## Features

- **Simulation training** – converse with AI patients through phase-based clinical encounters and receive real-time scoring and feedback.
- **Patient scenario generator** – create custom patient profiles manually or from natural-language descriptions that are expanded with Gemini.
- **Help & advice** – ask the AI for cultural or clinical guidance during a simulation.
- **Local patient library** – save generated patients in the browser for later use.
- **Automatic translation** – patient responses are translated to English when needed so providers can always understand them.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```
   npm install
   npm --prefix functions install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The app is served at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Build for production**

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Firebase Functions**

   - Functions are located in the `functions/` directory.
   - Use the Firebase CLI for emulation or deployment:

     ```
     npm --prefix functions run serve   # local emulator
     npm --prefix functions run deploy  # deploy to Firebase
     ```

   The Cloud Function expects a `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret containing a Google Gemini API key.
   For local development, you can create `functions/.env` with:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

   The React app can point to the local emulator by defining `REACT_APP_FUNCTION_URL` in a root `.env` file:

   ```
   REACT_APP_FUNCTION_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001/echo-d825e/us-central1/echoSimulator
   ```

   When this variable is set the client will try the emulator first and fall back to the deployed
   Cloud Function if the local call fails.
