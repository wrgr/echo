/**
 * ECHO Application Root Component
 * 
 * This is the main application component that provides the overall structure,
 * navigation, and routing for the ECHO (Effective Conversations for Healthcare
 * Optimization) clinical simulation platform.
 * 
 * ECHO System Overview:
 * ECHO is an AI-powered clinical simulation platform designed to help healthcare
 * providers practice patient interactions with diverse, culturally-sensitive
 * virtual patients. The system emphasizes:
 * 
 * - Cultural competency training through diverse patient scenarios
 * - Patient-centered communication skill development
 * - Biopsychosocial approach to clinical encounters
 * - Real-time feedback and coaching during simulations
 * - Comprehensive scoring based on clinical communication rubrics
 * 
 * Application Architecture:
 * - React-based single-page application with client-side routing
 * - Firebase Cloud Functions backend for AI processing and patient management
 * - Local storage for user-generated patient scenarios
 * - Modular component design for maintainability and extensibility
 * 
 * Core Components:
 * 1. SimulationPage: Main clinical encounter simulation interface
 * 2. PatientIntakeForm: Patient scenario creation and management
 * 3. HelpPage: AI-powered advisory system for clinical guidance
 * 
 * Technical Implementation:
 * - Uses React Router for single-page application navigation
 * - Responsive design for desktop and mobile usage
 * - Consistent styling and theming across all components
 * - Error boundary handling and graceful degradation
 * - Accessibility considerations throughout the interface

 *    - Progress tracking and learning analytics
 * 
 * 2. Enhanced Patient Library:
 *    - Searchable patient scenario database
 *    - Community-contributed patient scenarios
 *    - Scenario difficulty ratings and learning objectives
 *    - Import/export functionality for sharing between institutions
 * 
 * 3. Assessment and Analytics:

 *   for large institutional deployments
 * 
 * - Performance: Consider implementing caching strategies, lazy loading,
 *   and code splitting for better performance with larger user bases
 * 
 * - Security: Implement comprehensive security measures including data
 *   encryption, secure authentication, and compliance with healthcare
 *   data protection regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
 * 
 * - Monitoring: Add comprehensive logging, error tracking, and performance
 *   monitoring to support production deployments
 * 
 * - Testing: Implement comprehensive test suites including unit tests,
 *   integration tests, and end-to-end testing for reliability
